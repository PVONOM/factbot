[Intro: A.J. & Big Justice]
We bring the boom
That's what we do
We bring the boom
We bring the boom to you
We bring the boom
Across the red, white, and blue
We bring the boom
You gotta meet our crew

[Verse 1: The Rizzler]
You know me as The Rizzler
I'm the panther dressed in black
Once I give your girl the rizz face
There's no chance she's comin' back
I hang with A.J. and Big Justice
Bring the boom, you know it's on
We're like the three evolutions of Pok√©mon
